## From Zero to DSP

Notebooks on working with digital signals (audio) in Python.

No math beyond high school math needed. Basic programming skills required.


## Useful resources

* [A Compact Primer On Digital Signal Processing](https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/index.html) - a very gentle introduction to DSP (with a lot of links to additional materials), great interactive visualizations, best place to start
* [Very good intro to audio](https://github.com/mogwai/fastai_audio/blob/master/tutorials/01_Intro_to_Audio.ipynb) with a focus on deep learning
* [But what is the Fourier Transform? A visual introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY) by 3Blue1Brown
